# yaci

`yaci` is a command-line tool that connects to a gRPC server and extracts blockchain data.

Tested with Cosmos SDK v0.50.x.

## Use-case

Off-chain indexing of block & transaction data.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23.1
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

## Features

- Ability to extract block and transaction chain data to various output formats:
  - JSON
  - TSV
  - PostgreSQL
- Supports server reflection; no need to specify the proto file.
- (Nested) `Any` type are properly decoded.
- Live monitoring of the blockchain.
- Batch extraction of data.

## Installation

To install the `yaci` tool, you need to have Go installed on your system. Then, you can use the following command to install `yaci`:

```sh
go install github.com/liftedinit/yaci@latest
```

The `yaci` binary will be installed in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage
The basic usage of the yaci tool is as follows:
```shell
yaci [command] [address] [flags]
```

## Commands

- `extract` - Extracts blockchain data to various output format.
- `version` - Prints the version of the tool. 

## Global Flags

- `-l`, `--logLevel` - The log level (default: "info")'

## Extract Command

Extract blockchain data and output it in the specified format.

## Flags

The following flags are available for all `extract` subcommand:

- `-t`, `--block-time` - The time to wait between each block extraction (default: 2s)
- `-s`, `--start` - The starting block height to extract data from (default: 1)
- `-e`, `--stop` - The stopping block height to extract data from (default: 1)
- `-k`, `--insecure` - Skip TLS certificate verification (default: false)'
- `--live` - Continuously extract data from the blockchain (default: false)
- `-r`, `--max-retries` - The maximum number of retries to connect to the gRPC server (default: 3)
- `-c`, `--max-concurrency` - The maximum number of concurrent requests to the gRPC server (default: 100)

### Subcommands

- `json` - Extracts blockchain data to JSON files.
- `tsv` - Extracts blockchain data to TSV files.
- `postgres` - Extracts blockchain data to a PostgreSQL database.

### JSON Subcommand

Extract blockchain data and output it in JSON format.

#### Usage

```
Usage:
  yaci extract json [address] [flags]
```

#### Flags

- `-o`, `--out` - The output directory to store the extracted data (default: "out")

#### Example

```shell
yaci extract json localhost:9090 -k -s 1 -e 100 -o ./data
```

This command will connect to the gRPC server running on `localhost:9090`, extract data from block height `1` to `100`, and store the extracted data in the `data` directory.

### TSV Subcommand

Extract blockchain data and output it in TSV format.

#### Usage

```
Usage:
  yaci extract tsv [address] [flags]
```

#### Flags

- `-o`, `--out` - The output directory to store the extracted data (default: "tsv")

#### Example

```shell
yaci extract tsv localhost:9090 -k -s 1 -e 100
```

This command will connect to the gRPC server running on `localhost:9090`, extract data from block height `1` to `100`, and store the extracted data in the `tsv` directory in the `blocks.tsv` and `transactions.tsv` files.

### PostgreSQL Subcommand

Extract blockchain data and output it to a PostgreSQL database.

#### Usage

```
Usage:
  yaci extract postgres [address] [flags]
```

#### Flags

- `-p`, `--postgres-conn` - The PostgreSQL connection string

#### Example

```shell
yaci extract postgres localhost:9090 -p postgres://postgres:foobar@localhost/postgres -s 106000 -k --live -t 5
```

This command will connect to the gRPC server running on `localhost:9090`, continuously extract data from block height `106000` and store the extracted data in the `postgres` database. New blocks and transactions will be inserted into the database every 5 seconds.

## Configuration

The `yaci` tool parameters can be configured from the following sources:

- Environment variables (prefixed with `YACI_`)
- Configuration file (`config.yaml`, `config.json`, `config.toml`, `config.hcl`, `config.env`)
- Command-line flags

The command-line flags have the highest priority, followed by the environment variables, and then the configuration file.

The environment variables are prefixed with `YACI_` and are in uppercase. For example, the `--logLevel` flag can be set using the `YACI_LOGLEVEL` environment variable. Dash (`-`) is replaced with underscore (`_`). For example, the `--block-time` flag can be set using the `YACI_BLOCK_TIME` environment variable.

The configuration file is searched in the following order:
- The current working directory (`./`)
- The user's home directory (`$HOME/.yaci`)
- The system's configuration directory (`/etc/yaci`)

## Demo

To run the demo, you need to have Docker installed on your system. Then, you can run the following command:

```shell
# Build and start the e2e environment
make docker-up
```

Wait for the e2e environment to start. Then, open a new browser tab and navigate to http://localhost:3000/blocks?order=id.desc to view the blocks and to http://localhost:3000/transactions to view the transactions.

Run

```shell
make docker-down
```

to stop the e2e environment.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, you can use the following command:

```shell
make test
```

To run the end-to-end tests, you can use the following command:

```shell
make test-e2e
```
